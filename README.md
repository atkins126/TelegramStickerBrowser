# TelegramStickerBrowser
A browser for Telegram Stickers (tgs) and Lottie (JSON) files written in Delphi with Skia4Delphi.

This uses the [Skia4Delphi library](https://github.com/skia4delphi/skia4delphi). Be sure you've installed the latest version from the **GetIt** package manager.

Includes a small selection of stickers downloaded from [LottieFiles](https://lottiefiles.com/animated-stickers). You can download additional stickers from Telegram via the [@Stickerdownloadbot](https://t.me/Stickerdownloadbot).
